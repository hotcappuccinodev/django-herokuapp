# Deploys the app to Heroku.
#
# This script is designed to be run either from a development
# machine, or from within a headless Continuous Integration (CI)
# environment.
#
# When run from a development machine, it simply deploys the app
# to Heroku.
#
# When run from a CI machine (signified by the CI environmental
# variable being set to "true"), it first performs an install of
# the app's environment, followed by a test, before deploying.
#
# In the default configuration, when deploying from either Travis CI,
# Drone.io or Jenkins CI environments, (or anything that sets the
# GIT_BRANCH environmental) variable, only the master branch will trigger
# a deploy. This is intended to allow feature branches to be created that
# do not trigger a deploy, but still trigger the test suite.
